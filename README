# OpenCV Basics Repository

Welcome to the **OpenCV Basics Repository**! This repository contains fundamental OpenCV operations that serve as a foundation for image processing and computer vision tasks.

## Features
- Reading and displaying images
- Converting images to grayscale
- Image resizing and cropping
- Drawing shapes and text on images
- Applying filters and edge detection
- Video processing with OpenCV
- Basic object detection

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
